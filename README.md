### SWDV691 - Software Development Capstone

Time Detective is a web application which allows you to decide on important recurring tasks and track how much time you spend on each one. The application will provide summary statistics as well as allow the user to perform more detailed analytics about how they are spending their time.

This web application is my final project for my Master's in Software Development from Maryville University.

### Prerequisites

This repository is the front-end user interface and requires the backend service at [SWDV619 - Services](https://github.com/mikecolbert2/SWDV691-Services) to be installed and running first.
